# MODAL_Sigma
This is the project of MODAL INF473XHACKING of Ã‰cole Polytechnique. 

In this project, I defined the necessary functions for TCP-SYN-FLOODING attack and L2-FLOODING attack which is used to do the kill-switch-kill operation.

The DNS-Hijacking, DHCP-Spoofing functions will be added then.

And, the current structure of project is not so well-defined. I will update it then (if I still have the will..).
